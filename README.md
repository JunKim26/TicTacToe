# TicTacToe

In this program, I have written a class named TicTacToe that has two private data members: the board, which will be a list of lists that represent a 3x3 board, and the current state.
If you are unfamiliar with the game known in the U.S.A. as tic-tac-toe, please see this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).
